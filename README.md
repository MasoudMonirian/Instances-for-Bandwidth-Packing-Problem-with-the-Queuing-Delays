# Instances-for-Bandwidth-Packing-Problem-with-the-Queuing-Delays

In this repository, you can find the instances that were used for the paper "A Conic Integer Programming Approach to the Bandwidth Packing Problem with Queuing Delays."

The first four rows represent the number of calls ( $M$ ), the number of nodes ( $N$ ), the node degree, and the percentage of the maximum number of possible messages/calls ($P$). The next $N$ rows indicate the linkâ€™s capacity ( $Q_{ij}$ ). The next four rows indicate the origin ( $O^m$ ), destination ( $D^m$ ), demand ( $d^m$ ), and revenue of each call ( $r^m$ ). The last value specifies the unit queueing delay cost per unit time ( $C$ ).
