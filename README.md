# Instances-for-Bandwidth-Packing-Problem-with-the-Queuing-Delays

In this repository, you can find the instances that were used for the paper "A Conic Integer Programming Approach to the Bandwidth Packing Problem with Queuing Delays."

The first two rows represent the number of calls ( $M$ ) and the number of nodes ( $N$ ). The next $N$ rows indicate the linkâ€™s capacity ( $Q_{ij}$ ). The next four rows indicate the origin ( $O^m$ ), destination ( $D^m$ ), demand ( $d^m$ ), and revenue of each call ( $r^m$ ). The last two values specify the unit queueing delay cost per unit time ( $C$ ) and the maximum number of possible calls ( $P$ ).
